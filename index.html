       LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.<br>
       <br>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.<br>
       <br>CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:<br>

       <ul>
           <li>the Cold War</li>
           <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
           <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
       </ul>
