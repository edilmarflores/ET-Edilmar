        <p>Much of the astronomical data pertaining to the sun, moon and stars is fascinating but requires an advanced understanding of scientific principles to fully comprehend. 
           When put in layman’s terms, however, there are some interesting and fun facts about the sun, moon and stars that can broaden your understanding of the universe.
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>

        <p>When we look at the stars in the night sky, it is difficult to imagine that our blazing sun is also a star. 
           It is the star nearest to the Earth. Although the sun is close to the Earth in cosmic terms, it is still 93 million miles away.
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>

        <h4>The Sun</h4>

        <p>The sun has been shining for 4.6 billion years and has remained relatively unchanged over time. The core temperature of the sun is 15 million degrees Celsius or 27 million degrees Fahrenheit, hotter than anything found on earth, even the earth’s fiery core. 
           Electricity can be generated from the sun's heat. Referred to as solar energy, it can be captured using solar reflective panels and stored in batteries or transferred directly into the electrical grid. The sun is made of at least 90 percent hydrogen (H) and it gives off energy in the process of converting hydrogen to helium (He).

        <p>Sun Spots and Solar Flares<br></p>

        <p>A sunspot is a vortex of gas on the surface of the sun and is several thousand degrees hotter than the rest of the sun. Some sunspots are so small they cannot be seen with a telescope, while other sunspots are larger than the earth. 
           They usually appear in pairs or groups and can last for months. 
           Solar flares are abrupt releases of solar energy from a sunspot that are invisible in ordinary light, despite the fact they emit the equivalent of the entire sun's energy in 0.25 seconds.
        
        </p>

        <h4>The Moon</h4>
        <p>The moon’s surface is covered with craters from meteorites crashing into the surface from space. 
           Because the moon is so small -- one-sixth the size of the earth -- it is unable to hold an atmosphere to protect it from the onslaught of passing meteors. 
           It also has very little gravitational pull, and walking on the moon is much harder than here on earth. The moon is the only celestial body other than earth that man has landed and walked on.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            There are so many stars in the universe that it is impossible to count them all. About 7,000 stars can be seen with the naked eye from earth. Many stars and constellations were named in ancients times for gods and animals that they resembled. 
            Many stars that are visible no longer exist, but because their light takes so long to reach the earth, they are still visible long after they have expired. 
            The turbulence in earth's atmosphere is the reason why the stars appear to twinkle when we look at them. This is example of qoute. - The Star.
        </blockquote>

        <h4>Size and Age</h4>

        <p>The sun is 109 times wider than the Earth and 330,000 times heavier. 
           The sun formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago and will burn for an estimated 5 billion years more, so the sun is at the mid-point of its lifespan.
        </p>

        <p>The sun is completely gaseous. There is no solid surface. The sun is composed of 74 percent hydrogen, 25 percent helium and 1 percent other gases. The sun is composed of several layers. The sun's surface is made up of thick gases and is referred to as the photosphere. 
           Two layers of atmosphere, called the chromosphere and the corona, cover the photosphere. The corona is the outermost layer of the sun. Beneath the photosphere lies three hot layers called the core, the radiative zone and the convective zone. 
           Gravity holds the sun together.
        </p>

        <p>The temperature at the photosphere is approximately 10,000 degrees F. The estimated temperature at the sun's core is 27 million degrees F. The sun burns more than 7 million tons of natural gas every second. 
           Without the light and heat from the sun, the Earth would be unable to support life.

                   <h4>Beauty Of Creation</h4>
                   <p>Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The Moon formed roughly 20 million years later. 
                      Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

                        the third day - dry land, seas, plants and trees were created.

                        <p>God exists as the Trinity- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God created humanity in God's image, therefore God created humanity as relational beings as God is relational.
                           Humanity was created first to relate to God and secondly to relate to one another.
